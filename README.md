# Trampoline World Cup Management System (STMT) - System Architecture & UML Design

## Overview

This repository showcases the complete system design and UML diagrams for the Trampoline World Cup Management System (STMT), a comprehensive information system conceptualized for a major trampolining competition. This project was developed for the Modeling and Design course at the Polytechnic of Coimbra.

The primary focus of this repository is to demonstrate the **analysis and design process** of a complex software system through a detailed set of UML diagrams. My core contribution to this project was the creation of all the visual models that define the system's architecture, features, and behavior.

## My Role and Contributions

As the system designer on this project, my responsibility was to translate the functional requirements into a clear and well-structured set of UML diagrams. This repository contains all the key design artifacts I created, including:

* **Use Case Diagrams:** To map out the interactions between different user roles (actors) and the system's functionalities.
* **Domain Model:** To establish a conceptual blueprint of the system's main entities and their relationships.
* **Activity Diagrams:** To visualize the flow of various processes, such as participant registration and score calculation.
* **System Sequence Diagrams (SSD):** To illustrate the high-level interactions between external actors and the system for specific use cases.
* **Class Diagrams:** To define the static structure of the system, detailing classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.
* **Sequence Diagrams:** To model the dynamic interactions between objects in a time-ordered sequence, providing a detailed view of how the system operates internally.

This collection of diagrams serves as a portfolio of my skills in object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) and my ability to model complex systems using UML.

## System Concept

The STMT is a system designed to automate the management of a large-scale trampolining event. The diagrams illustrate how the system would handle:

* **Automated Scheduling:** Generation of competition, training, and meal schedules.
* **Participant Management:** Registration and data management for athletes, coaches, judges, etc., with integration with national federation systems (SIFN).
* **Scoring and Results:** Real-time calculation of scores, rankings, and athlete progression through the competition stages.
* **Logistics:** Management of accommodation and meal schedules for all participants.

## Project Phases

The project was structured in three phases, and my work was central to delivering the required artifacts for each:

* **Phase 1: Vision and Scope:** I developed the initial Use Case Diagrams that defined the system's boundaries and scope.
* **Phase 2: Problem Analysis:** I created the detailed Activity Diagrams and the Domain Model to provide a deeper understanding of the problem space.
* **Phase 3: Solution Design:** I designed the System Sequence Diagrams, Class Diagrams, and detailed Sequence Diagrams that form the blueprint for the system's implementation.
